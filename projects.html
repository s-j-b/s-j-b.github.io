<h5>4 Models - Project 2</h5>

<p> For our first model, we were excited by the idea of a box that
  doesn't appear to open or even contain another object. Because breakfast
  is the most important meal of the day, we decided to make a box to conceal
  2 hard-boiled eggs. Because of the comforting feel and pleasing shape, not
  to mention the pun, we chose to make an Egg box out of Uggs. </p>

  <p> In our research of decorative boxes, we encountered light boxes with interior
    illumination which makes patterns on the surrounding surface. We tried, somewhat unsuccessfully,
  to model this with the clay. </p>

<p>
  In our final iteration of this project, Steve and I spent a lot of time deliberating about what
  elements we wanted to keep and which elements we felt needed to change. We agreed that our final form
  should entirely be made up of octagons--using simple geometry to represent curves was the initial spark
  that got us working on our water tower model. We wanted the curves to be less symmetrical and functional
  than those of the water tower, but we also agreed that the form should be more visually appealing than
  our second model.<br /> <br />
  We revisited SketchUp and continued experimenting with bulges and twists, eventually
  settling on a wavy, tapered form, with a pipe-like opening at one end and a large round bulge at the other.
  We also wanted to ensure the final form would have an opening that traveled all the way through the sculpture.
  <br /><br />
  Once the octagons were cut and stacked, we began discussing the actual arrangment. We agreed that we wanted to
  arrange the octagons in an interesting way which told a story as the eye travelled down the deformed pipe.
  We agreed that the gradual rotation down the pipe was the most visually appealing, so we had the rotation
  change direction and increase/decrease in the amount of "entropy" of the movement of the octagons.
  <br /><br />
  Finally, we painted the sculpture white and constructed a copper base for the piece. We wanted continue
  with our hydraulic theme, inspired by the Horton Waterspheroid, and liked the color contrast of the white and
  copper. Also, because the of the wild, irregular form of the octagonal sculpture, we chose to have thin
  copper hoops "wrangling" around the scuplture to give it a sense of being tethered.

  Surprisingly, the copper was quite easy to work with! The soft flexible tubing was easy to deform (with a little
  elbow grease) and Jay hooked us up with a handsaw, vice, and file.

  To paint the inside of our form, I tried using semi-gloss spraypaint. Unfortunately,
  because the paint was oil based (instead of acrylic), the paint ate away at the foamcore
  and began to form holes! Fortunately, a friend from maintenance (coincidentally also named
  Jay) loaned me some quick drying clay powder to fill the holes in the sculpture.

<h5>Second Round Models</h5>
<p>
  For this second round, we elected to be more aggressive
  with what we included and excluded in our two models. We both loved the organic curves of the waterspheroid,
  but wanted to work against its simple symmetry. To do this, we chose to continue using octagons to simualate
  gradient in curvature. We felt that when appplied to an even more irregular form, we would be able to achieve
  the contrast we wanted.

  We also wanted to include a representation of the pipe from the water tower as well--the smooth cylinder gives
  an interesting directionality to the piece. Thus, we inverted the pipe shape and made a cylindrical hole
  to cut through all of our slices. The pipe goes through each octagonal slice at a slight angle, so its cross-
  sectional intersection is slightly elliptical.

<p>
  We constructed the octagonal "key faces" in SketchUp, and used the Curviloft extension to approximate the
  continuous curve that traces through each of them

<p>
  Next, we added a tube through our object, and set to trying to subtract
  it from the surrounding the form. We used Autodesk 123D to generate
  the cutting of our object.

<h5>  Models 1 & 2: Inspired by the Horton Waterspheroid </h5>
<p>
  Intrigued by the beautiful and challenging curvature of the Horton waterspheroid, we used this model to
  embrace the limitations of a discretized laminate structure approach. We sought to approximate the shape
  using carefully measured octagons, so the curve approximation occurs on two dimensions:
  top-down, and around the perimeter of each circle.

<h5> Models 3 & 4: Inspired by the negative space of the tennis courts</h5>

<p>
  The tennis courts have highly symmetrical perpendicular geometry. To subvert that, we analyzed the negative
  space present at the intersection of the ground and the walls. With this model, we aimed to subvert the
  natural tendency to let gravity and structure dictate the orientation of the laminate slices. Instead, here we
  achieve the three intersecting right-angles with a series of equilateral triangles.
